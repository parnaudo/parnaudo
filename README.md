# Summary
I'm passionate about solving complex engineering problems with pragmatic solutions by building effective and cohesive organizations of developers. I like learning and working at any part of the stack, from devops to analytics and everything in between.
- I've built high throughput and reliable infrastructure in a plethora of languages
- I've built multiple teams and organizations from single digit developers to acquisition and beyond
- I've managed pretty much every type of developer and love the challenge of getting all the pieces to work together
- I love interacting cross functionally and up/down the organization from ICs to executives
